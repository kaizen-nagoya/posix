           Official NIST-PCTS:151-2, October 1, 1995

The NIST-PCTS:151-2 is a POSIX conformance test suite (PCTS) written by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
It tests system implementations for conformance to FIPS 151-2.
FIPS 151-2 is based on the ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990 Portable Operating System
Interface (POSIX)--
Part 1:System Application Program Interface (API) [C Language]
and the additional requirements as restated in Appendix A of the
NIST-PCTS:151-2 Installation and Testing Guide.
The assertions tested by this PCTS are only those of the
IEEE Std 2003.1-1992 Test Methods for Measuring Conformance to POSIX.1
that relate to FIPS 151-2.

This distribution is fully contained within the compressed cpio archived
file NP_distr.Z.exe.

The documentation for the NIST-PCTS:151-2 is written in "troff" and
incorporates the "mm" macros.
The files ITG.ps and CVR.ps contain the postscript files for
the documents NIST-PCTS:151-2--Installation and Testing Guide and
NIST POSIX Testing Policy--Certificate of Validation Requirements
for FIPS 151-2 respectively.  These files are provided for those
that may not have the resources to generate the printable documents
from the distribution.

To install the Official NIST-PCTS:151-2:
